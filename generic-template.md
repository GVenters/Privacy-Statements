After we have passed on the data, we keep a copy of your application for 90 days. We do this for two reasons:
1)	So that we are able to re-transmit the application to the employing organisation if there is any issue during the employment process.
2)	So that you can apply for other opportunities without having to re-enter the information from the form.
