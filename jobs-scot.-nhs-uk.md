# Privacy Policy

## Our Policy for Storing information on the jobs.scot.nhs.uk website
Our policy is summarised in the commitments below:

*	We are committed to telling you what information we store about you. 
*	We are committed to telling you why we think we can store it.
*	We are committed to keeping what we store secure.
*	We are committed to giving you as much control over what we store as reasonably possible.
*	We are also committed to making these as clear as possible for you so if find some of the explanations on this page difficult to understand, please let us know. You can do this by sending an email to nss.showteam@nhs.net 

## Introduction
This page explains how we collect and use your personal data and how you can exercise control over what we do with it.
 
### What is personal data
Personal data is any data that relates to you and can be used on its own, or in combination with other information that we hold, to identify you. 

Examples of information that identifies you could be could be your home address, your email address, your passport number, your driving licence number or your NHS identifier (CHI number).

Examples of information that could be combined with other information to identify you could be your name, your date of birth, your postcode, your IP address or a web cookie, your ethnicity, religion, gender or religion.

Application forms that you can complete through this site may contain many of the above examples.

## What makes us think we can keep your information?  (Legal Basis for Storing the Data)
The legal basis for us keeping the data on this site is your consent. Tjhis means that we store information because we believe that you have given consent for us to do so.

Before we store personal information, we either ask for your consent or we state that by completing an action (for example, filling-in a form) that you give consent to us storing and processing your data.

## What do we think you have allowed us to store and what will we do with it?
We use the information that we collect for the purposes set out below.

If you complete an application then we believe:
1.	That you have allowed us to send on your application to the employers who are advertising jobs on this site. They will use the information for selection and recruitment of candidates seeking employment; for maintaining statistics on the fairness and equality of the recruitment process and, in the case of candidates who are successful in their applications, as part of their staff record. The actual employer that you send the information to is made clear in the advert for which you complete an application.

2.	That you have allowed us to keep a copy of your application for 90 days for the following purposes:

    * So that we are able to re-transmit the application to the employing organisation if there is any issue during the employment process.
    *	So that you can apply for other opportunities without having to re-enter the information from the form.
    
Note that providing data for the statistics that are used for maintaining a fair and equal recruitment process is optional and there will be no impact on your individual application for employment if you don't wish to answer these questions.

We believe that you have allowed us to do this as there is a notice at the beginning of our application form that tells you that you are giving consent when you complete an application.

## What if I want to withdraw my consent or want to be forgotten?

### Your right to be forgotten
Although we hold your information for the reasons set out above, you have rights for your data to be erased or “forgotten”.
In certain cases, these rights may be limited by 
*    legal obligations applicable to the controller; 
*    public interest;
*	scientific, statistical and historical archiving; and 
•	freedom of expression and information; 
•	the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 

But generally, we will erase your personal data without undue delay where:

1.	we no longer need it for the purposes that you have agreed to
2.	you withdraw your consent to us collecting, holding or processing your data
3.	we are otherwise obliged to remove the data

### Withdrawing consent
If you change your mind about giving your consent to us holding information on your application, you can let us know and we’ll remove your details once we have verified your identity.

You can let us know by sending an email to nss.showteam@nhs.net.

For our anonymous tracking cookies, you can effectively withdraw your consent at any time by using the Do Not Track settings within your browser or by removing the cookie from your browser. 

### Is there anything we keep that isn’t based on your consent?
Yes.
We keep session cookies (see our cookies page for more information).
We do this to be able to operate the site correctly. Session cookies are used to make sure that your session is kept separate from other users of the site and to make sure that things like going from page to page on the site work properly. These cookies only last for as long as we think you are using the site and are essential for the website to function properly and to maintain its security. 

We keep error and security logs for at least 12 months and potentially longer if we need to use them in connection with investigations of suspected malicious intent.

### How long we keep your data.

We take the information that we collect from your application forms and pass it on to the employer who is processing the vacancy so that they can progress your application. We keep your application on record for 90 days from the last time you applied.
We keep error and security logs for at least 12 months and potentially longer if we need to use them in connection with investigations of suspected malicious or illegal intent.

### Tracking cookies and compliance cookies

We keep anonymised tracking cookies that can’t be used to track you as an individual but do track how you use the website. Because they can’t be used to track you we don’t consider these to be personal information but we still need your consent to use. You can give your consent by clicking on the consent button on the cookie choice banner. If you click the “I consent” button, this will also set a compliance cookie that allows us to remember that you have given your consent. If you don’t click on the “I consent button” then the cookie notice will continue to appear whenever you access the site. We can only record consent on a device by device basis so if you access the site on a tablet, a work computer or a mobile phone, you’ll need to give consent for each one.

We will continue to review our use of these cookies as best practice develops and make efforts to comply with best practice on anonymised tracking cookies.

### International transfers
We do not transfer any of your data outwith the UK.

# Cookies, IP Addresses and other tracking mechanisms

## Cookies
When you use the website, we collect some information that is essential for the site to operate. We do this through cookies (see reference). We need to do this to make sure that you can currently navigate through the site and so that you’re not mixed up with other users. 
We also use cookies to track typical usage of the website by our users so that we can make improvements or changes to the site that are based on how it’s actually being used. 

### What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of information that is included with requests for web pages. They are stored by your browser on your device and sent to the website that you are requesting pages from. The Web application can read the information in cookies sent to it whenever the user visits the site from a browser which is storing cookies.
Cookies used for the essential operation of a website
| Cookie  | Expires  | 	Notes  |
|  ASP.net |  session id  | SessionId	Used for providing a consistent experience in your use of the website and distinguishing your visits to the site from other peoples while you are using the site.  |

## Tracking Cookies
We use tracking cookies to record information about your use of the website, for example, which pages you have visit, how long you visit the site for and where which pages you have landed on and how you have navigated through the site. 
We group all of the data we collect from these cookies to be able to find out:

•	how our audience is using the website and the services on it
•	where our audience is coming from
•	what devices and browsers are being used to interact with the service
•	as part of our research to improve the operation of the services being accessed through the website.

These are turned into aggregated reports which cannot be used to identify you and the raw data is discarded after 3 days. IP addresses are anonymised in the data collected.

The raw information gathered is not shared directly with any third party.  Aggregated reports which cannot be used to identify you may be shared with employers so that they can see how their job adverts are performing. These reports are retained on our reporting dashboards for 3 months. 

### Matomo analytics tracking cookies

| Cookie  | Expires  | 	Notes  |
|---|---|---|
| PIWIK_SESSID  | 	Session	  | We use the Matomo web tracking software to record information about your use of the website, for example, which pages you have visit, how long you visit the site for and where which pages you have landed on and how you have navigated through the site. This is done through use of tracking cookies. These are anonymised so they can’t be used to track you.  |

#### Our analytics will honour “Do Not Track” settings in your browser
Your browser should have a mechanism that will allow you to decide how cookies are to be treated. One of the settings that you can use is Do Not Track (see https://iapp.org/news/a/do-not-track-2-0/  for more information).

If you specify that you do not want us to track you using this mechanism, we will honour your decision.

For information about how to remove cookies from your device, or how to block individual cookies from being received, please see the instructions and guidance at ico.org.uk. (https://ico.org.uk/global/cookies/ )

## Other browser-based local storage mechanisms
As well as cookies, there are other similar ways of storing information on your browser, such as Web Storage and Indexed Database. We do not use these on this site but we'll inform you here if we do in future.

### IP addresses and log files
We collect a range of information on every request made for resources on this website in log files. We do this to measure the performance of the systems used to provide the site to maintain its security and to allow us to investigate in the event of suspected criminal activity.

We also use them on occasion to track access trends across a number of years (up to 3 years).

One of the items collected is the IP address associated with the device that is making a request. In certain circumstances, your IP address could be used to identify you. Because of this, we treat our log files for web requests as personal data and take steps to keep it secure and do not share un-anonymised log files with any 3rd party (except where we might need to do so in connection with suspected criminal activity or where otherwise legally bound to do so). For traffic that appears to be accessing the site appropriately, we anonymise IP addresses logs during the logging process. For traffic that generates warnings, errors or alerts, we keep the information for a minimum of 12 months – longer if the records are used in connection with an active investigation.

### Will anyone but you and NHS Scotland know that you’ve accessed this website?
Yes. Every time you access any website, there are likely to be intermediate providers (such as your Internet Service Provider) who because you make the requests through services provided by them, will know that someone has visited the website. 
We encrypt connections between you and the website so that those providers will not be able to get specific details about your visit unless they are practising SSL interception. If a site is legitimately practising SSL interception they should make you aware of this and do so only with your permission.

### Are there other ways that my use of the website might be tracked?
There are other ways that can identify your use of the website to another organisation. For example, if we included some code on the page that is used to get some of the page contents (such as fonts or JavaScript code) from another place. We do not use these mechanisms on this website.
